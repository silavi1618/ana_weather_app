### Instructions for how to build & run the app
Compile and run using flutter on emulator or actual device. Location and Internet permissions are required for the app to work.
### Time spent
Approx. 6 hours
### Assumptionsmade
No assumptions made.
### Shortcuts/Compromisesmade
I stored the name of the cities inside Shared Preferences, however this is not a good practice in real-world apps
### Why did you choose the technology/framework you used?
Per requirement
### Stretch goals attempted
I added multiple features like:
* City Lookup
* Storing maximum of 3 cities (can be changed inside code to any number)
* Remove feature from the stored cities
* Refresh button (refreshes current location + all stored locations + looked up location)
* Used toast alert to better display messages
* Separated service classes from widget classes
* Made WeatherCard widget with different properties
